/**
 * Cross-process shared memory for node.js cluster module, implemented using node.js IPC.
 *
 * The shared memory is managed by the master process, and the worker processes reads and
 * writes the shared memory by requesting the master process.
 *
 * Since IPC needs to serialize and deserialize the transmitted json data, it is not recommend
 * to write large objects to the shared memory which will cause too much CPU usage.
 *
 * There is no automatic memory cleaning, please remember to remove the useless objects in
 * the shared memory to prevent memory overflow.
